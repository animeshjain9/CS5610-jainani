    This expriment shows how passport.js can be setup. This involves the importing of libraris and setting up of serialization and deserialization strategies. This is a demonstration of Passport.js with mongoDB and node.js Passport.js is the leading library for Node.js for authentication and authorization. It normally registers users into MongoDB and then authenticates based on it.<br />
    I have also worked on the main experiments which are as follows<br />
    1.Setup and Initialization<br />
    2.Registration using passport.js<br />
    3.Login Error using Passport.js<br />
    4.Logout using passport.js<br />
