    On a high level, AngularJS is a framework that binds your HTML (views) to JavaScript objects (models). When your models change, the page updates automatically.<br/>
    The opposite is also true – a model, associated with a text field, is updated when the content of the field is changed. Angular handles all the glue code, so you don’t have to update HTML manually or listen for events, like you do with jQuery.
    As a matter of fact, none of the examples here even include jQuery!<br/>
    To use AngularJS, you have to include it in your page before the closing body<br/>
        tag. Google’s CDN is recommended for a faster load time:.<br />
