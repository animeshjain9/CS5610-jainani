<h3>MongoDB Experiments</h3>

    MongoDB (from humongous) is a cross-platform document-oriented database. Classified as a NoSQL database, MongoDB eschews the traditional table-based relational database structure in favor of JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas (MongoDB calls the format BSON), making the integration of data in certain types of applications easier and faster. Released under a combination of the GNU Affero General Public License and the Apache License, MongoDB is free and open-source software.<br />
    I have also worked on the some experiments which are as follows<br />
    1.Mongoose setup and Home Page<br />
    2.Create a record in MongoDb<br />
    3.Update a record in MongoDb<br />
    4.Delete a record in MongoDb<br />
    5.Read All Records From MongoDb<br />
